# Portfolio Optimization Project

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates portfolio optimization using historical stock data. The objective is to minimize portfolio risk while maintaining acceptable returns.

## Features
- Mean-variance optimization for portfolio allocation.
- Use of historical stock price data from Yahoo Finance.
- Visualization of portfolio weights.
- Insights into portfolio risk and return trade-offs.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Libraries: `numpy`, `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `scipy`, `yfinance`

## How to Run
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/KaranJ09/Portfolio-Optimisation
2. Install the required librares:
   pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Run the portfolio_optimization.ipynb notebook.

## Results
- Optimized portfolio weights: Diversified allocation based on risk and return.
- Portfolio visualization: Bar chart of weight distribution.

## Insights
The project highlights how optimization reduces risk while achieving an acceptable return, demonstrating key quantitative finance techniques.
